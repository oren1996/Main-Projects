## Main-Projects

### Comprehensive Job Search Web Application Using LLM
Played a significant role in developing the final project for my degree. Contributions were primarily in backend development built with Flask, including the implementation of job scraping algorithms using Selenium, preprocessing and translating data when needed, and creating prompts for the Gemini API to generate new features based on job descriptions. Additionally, worked on the frontend, implementing filtering logic and a little bit of aesthetic. <br>

### Children Stories AI Generation
Developed a system for generating children's stories using AI, where users can create stories individually or collaborate with others. The platform allows users to select story elements such as the main character, plot, and illustrations style, while the text and images are generated using Gemini and OpenAI APIs. Implemented with Flask, Docker, and MongoDB, focusing on real-time collaboration, asynchronous processing, and user authentication. <br>

### From Text to LLM to G-code
Worked on an innovative system that converts plain text descriptions into virtual 3D models using a finetuned GPT-4 model within a multi-agent framework. Users can then visualize and interactively modify these models in a user-friendly interface before generating 3D printing instructions (G-code). <br>

### Sign Language Detection Using Computer Vision
Developed a comprehensive system for detecting and interpreting sign language via a webcam. The project focuses on recognizing individual letters of the sign language alphabet using advanced image processing libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe and classification algorithms. <br>
