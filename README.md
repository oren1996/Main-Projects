### 1) **Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models**

- **Comprehensive Job Search Web Application Using LLM**
Played a significant role in developing the final project for my degree. Contributions were primarily in backend development built with Flask, including the implementation of job scraping algorithms using Selenium, preprocessing and translating data when needed, and creating prompts for the Gemini API to generate new features based on job descriptions. Additionally, worked on the frontend, implementing filtering logic and a little bit of aesthetic.

- **Children Stories AI Generation**
Developed a system for generating children's stories using AI, where users can create stories individually or collaborate with others. The platform allows users to select story elements such as the main character, plot, and illustrations style, while the text and images are generated using Gemini and OpenAI APIs. Implemented with Flask, Docker, and MongoDB, focusing on real-time collaboration, asynchronous processing, and user authentication.

- **Conversational Agent for E-commerce Platform**
Developed an AI-powered conversational agent (chatbot) for an e-commerce platform using Python, Flask, OpenAI API, and LLM technology. The chatbot provides natural language customer support, handling queries such as order status, return policies, and requests for human representatives. Set up and populated a database using custom scripts. Evaluated the chatbot's performance and accuracy with custom Python evaluation scripts, focusing on the effectiveness of the AI and LLM integration.

- **From Text to LLM to G-code**
Worked on an innovative system that converts plain text descriptions into virtual 3D models using a finetuned GPT-4 model within a multi-agent framework. Users can then visualize and interactively modify these models in a user-friendly interface before generating 3D printing instructions (G-code). For the backend i used python and Flask.

### 2) **Computer Vision**

- **Sign Language Detection Using Computer Vision**
Developed a comprehensive system for detecting and interpreting sign language via a webcam. The project focuses on recognizing individual letters of the sign language alphabet using advanced image processing libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe and classification algorithms and python.

### 3) **Machine Learning**

- **Machine Learning Project in Python**
This project demonstrates proficiency in essential machine learning skills using Python, including data preprocessing (handling missing values, removing duplicates, encoding categorical variables, and normalization), exploratory data analysis, and the development of both classification models (XGBoost, Random Forest, LGBM, Keras neural network) and regression models (Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, and Ridge regression). It highlights expertise in hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and the use of various evaluation metrics to optimize and assess model performance, effectively managing overfitting and underfitting. The project utilizes tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Keras.

### 4) **Data Analysis and Visualization**

- **Israel's Economic Trends: From 2021 to 2023**
Collaborated to create a comprehensive dashboard analyzing Israelâ€™s economic trends from 2021 to 2023, categorized by diverse categories. The dashboard visualized key metrics such as the ability to handle unexpected expenses, overdraft occurrences, and budgetary distress. My role included data cleaning, analysis, and designing interactive visualizations in Tableau. The project involved working with multiple survey responses from Paamonim Association, focusing on simplifying complex economic data for a general audience.
